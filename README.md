## ⚠️ Upgrading from 1.0.0

2.0.0 renames the mod id from `alphabet_block` to `colored_alphabet_blocks`. Every
block and item id changed with it, so **back up your world before upgrading**.

Old worlds are migrated automatically on all three loaders — placed blocks and
items in chests or inventories keep their background and glyph colors. No
external tool is needed.

| Loader   | Mechanism                                     |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| NeoForge | `Registry#addAlias`                           |
| Forge    | `MissingMappingsEvent` remap                  |
| Fabric   | Mixin on `MappedRegistry` lookups             |

Migration happens per chunk, the first time that chunk loads after the upgrade.
A chunk keeps the old names on disk until a player goes there and the game saves
it again, so this migration code stays in the mod permanently rather than being
removed in a later release.

Block and item names themselves did not change — only the namespace:

```
alphabet_block:letter_a    ->  colored_alphabet_blocks:letter_a
alphabet_block:empty_block ->  colored_alphabet_blocks:empty_block
```

Config files under `config/alphabet_block-*.toml` are orphaned by the rename and
can be deleted.

Separately, 1.0.0 shipped its loot tables in a folder Minecraft never reads, so
blocks dropped nothing when broken. 2.0.0 fixes that; letter blocks now drop
themselves.
